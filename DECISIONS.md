# DECISIONS.md — Lawrence Private Collection

Append-only. Each entry: date, decision, alternatives considered, reason, reversibility.
This is what the client reviews at handover instead of being interrupted (spec §1.3).

## 2026-09-28 — Bootstrap the Lawrence repo from the finished Waterline scaffold

**Decision**: Start the Lawrence build from a copy of the completed WATERLINE repository rather
than a fresh `create-next-app` scaffold, then rebrand and re-derive each phase against the
Lawrence spec (LAWRENCE-Private-Collection-Spec-v2.pdf) in the order of `DEVELOPMENT-PHASES.md`.

**Alternatives**: (a) Fresh scaffold from scratch per Prompt 1; (b) shared monorepo with Waterline.

**Reason**: The two portals share the same stack and structure (README-START-HERE.md notes the
second build is ~40% faster). The Waterline scaffold already satisfies every Phase 1 deliverable:
Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript strict, Payload 3 with the Postgres adapter, a Zod-validated
env module (`src/config/env.ts`), docker-compose with PostGIS + Typesense, and CI running Vitest,
Playwright + axe, Lighthouse and a bundle budget. A monorepo was rejected per the handover
instruction: do not share code between the portals before both are live — this is a fork, not a
shared library.

**Reversibility**: Full — any inherited Waterline behaviour that conflicts with the Lawrence spec
is replaced in the phase that owns it (tokens in Phase 2, data model in Phase 3, access layer in
Phase 5, and so on).

## 2026-09-28 — Repository identity renamed waterline → lawrence

**Decision**: Rename the package, docker services/volumes, local database, CI workflow env and
`src/config/brand.ts` to Lawrence identity. Placeholder domain `lawrenceprivatecollection.com`
until the client confirms the domain (§1.5 item 1).

**Alternatives**: Keep waterline identifiers until later phases.

**Reason**: Phase 1's deliverable is the guardrail layer for *this* project; leaving the sibling
project's name in CI env, DB names and brand config guarantees confusing leakage into every
subsequent phase (emails, JSON-LD, OG images).

**Reversibility**: Full — identity lives in `src/config/brand.ts`, env defaults and compose/CI
files only.
